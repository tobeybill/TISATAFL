										<p>There is a larger scale for CEO compensation than director compensation with an outlier of CEO compensation above 1600% of predicted pay. On the BOD side, a separate outlier sits at roughly 800% of predicted pay. Additionally, it appears that medium-sized firms are responsible for the majority of CEO overpayment whereas smaller firms are more responsible for director overpayment. In both cases, firm performance for larger firms seems to be less volatile than that for the other two size categories. That said, it is possible that large firms are less volitile due to the determinants we picked. Because the accounting variables for large firms are so much greater than the other size firms, the model may have had more tolerance for change in CEO compensation.</p>

									<p>Separating out our various firms in the above four cases, we found that large firms with an underpaid CEO and overpaid BOD perform the best. Small firms with underpaid CEO and BOD perform the worst. It is also important to note that, for large firms, overpayment of the CEO results in poor performance while it improves firm performance for medium and small firms. Small firms had heavy positive impacts after overpaying their CEO's.</p>

													<h2>Conclusion</h2>
												</div>
											</header>
											
											
											<p>Since the mid 20th century, CEO and director compensation has has ballooned and caught the attention of many. The drastic increase in CEO compensation has often called its legitimacy into question. Does paying the higherups oversized saleries really make an impact? We've found that, in certain cases, it does.</p>
											<p>Our results have supported our hypothesis in the following ways.</p>
											<ol>
												<li>Both CEOs and directors are overcompensated: Firm performance will suffer in large firms due to backscratching and underperforming executives, but is improved for mid-size and small firms.</li>
												<li>The CEO is overcompensated and directors are undercompensated: Firm performance will excel in mid-size and small firms due to a more qualified CEO and strong controls over the board of directors, but will be hurt in large firms.</li>
												<li>The CEO is undercompensated and directors are overcompensated: Firm performance will suffer in small firms because the directors are self serving and less motivated to replace the CEO in fear of loosing their compensation, but will improve in large and mid-size firms.</li>
												<li>Both CEOs and directors are undercompensated: Firm performance will excel in large and mid-size firms because the firm has strong governance to prevent overcompensation, but will suffer for the smaller size firms due to lack of adequate motivation.</li>
											</ol>
