											<p><a href = "https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-in-2020/" target="_blank" class="image right"><img src="images/ceo_comp.jpg" alt="" /></a>Executive compensation has ballooned over the past 40 years with an increase in pay of 1,167% relative to the growth of the S&P 500 at 741% (Bouteska & Mefteh-Wali). This discrepancy has raised many eyebrows in academia, the public, and media. If executive compensation growth has outweighed the growth of the market are the higher ups really performing better or have they colluded with their governing bodies, the board of directors, to pay themselves an outsized share of the profits? Furthermore, what impact does this have on firm performance?</p>
											<p>Dah and Frya found that directors were overcompensated more often than not, with their average overcompensation exceeding their average undercompensation, leading to reduced CEO turnover sensitivity and a decrease in CEO pay-for-performance sensitivity (Dah & Frya). This indicates that overpaid directors may be hesitant to remove CEOs for fear of decreasing their own pay. Additionally, overpaid directors may be less likely to dock CEO pay for poor performance in case the CEO retaliates by docking their pay as well.</p>
											<p>Another study touches on the determinants of CEO compensation through 2006-2016. The study found several categories of determinants that impacted compensation: accounting and performance, CEO power, and governance. CEO pay had a higher correlation on firm performance in more mature firms when compared to younger firms. High CEO power over the board led to an increase in compensation, while strong governance led to a decrease in compensation (Bouteska & Mefteh-Wali). </p>
											<p>A paper on the impact of CEO compensation and director compensation on firm performance found a strong positive correlation between CEO and director compensation. The paper also found a relationship between overcompensation and underperformance; concluding that overcompensation is due to poor governance and backscratching (Brick, Palmon, & Wald). </p>
											<p>This research prompted us to further explore these relationships and focus on four cases of CEO and director compensation. Through our analysis, we hope to add further evidence of the impact of executive compensation on firm performance.</p>
