									<h2>Abstract:</h2>
									<p>This study examines the impact of CEO and Director compensation and firm performance (measured as Tobin's Q). After conducting regression on a series of determinants to determine if CEOs and directors were overcompensated, four use cases were created with the following hypotheses:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Both CEOs and directors are overcompensated: Firm performance will suffer due to backscratching and underperforming executives.</li>
										<li>Both CEOs and directors are undercompensated: Firm performance will suffer due to underqualified executives.</li>
										<li>The CEO is overcompensated and directors are undercompensated: Firm performance will excel due to a more qualified CEO and strong controls over the board of directors.</li>
										<li>The CEO is undercompensated and directors are overcompensated: Firm performance will excel due to more qualified directors and a strong governing body overseeing the CEO.</li>
										<li>Etiam vel felis lorem.</li>
										<li>Felis enim et feugiat.</li>
									</ol>
									<p>These hypotheses were correlated with Tobin's Q and a series of control variables. The study found that _____________. There were several sources of error contributing to _______ and _______. Further analysis should be conducted to explore _______.</p>
