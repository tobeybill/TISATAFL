												<h2> Data</h2>
											</div>
											
										</header>
										<p>All of our data was extracted from WRDS. All data regarding director and CEO compensation and demographics came from Execucomp. Firm accounting variables and other firm specific information came from Compustat. All stock prices were pulled from CRSP.</p>
										<p>We cross referenced multiple studies to find determinants of CEO and director compensation as well as firm performance. Our sample size comprised of firms in the S&P500 from 2010 - 2019. We chose 2010-2019 to avoid the corporate scandals of the early 2000's and the impact of COVID on the market.</p>
										<hr />
										<div class="title">
											<h3> BOD Compensation and Determinants </h3>
										</div>
										<p>Director compensation was derived as their total compensation including cash, value of stock options and option awards, non-equity incentive plan compensation, change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings, and all other compensation.</p>
										<p>We used accounting based firm valuations and market performance as determinants for predicting Board of Directors compensation. The accounting variables are lagged one year, because we are assuming that pay is impacted by previous years performance. The accounting metrics of a firm are resilient to equity market changes. These metrics focus on internal firm performance, which will reduce the impact a strong market position will have on predicted compensation. A strong market artificially inflates firm values, even if the firm is not doing well internally. We included market performance determinants in our analysis because BOD packages usually contain some equity incentive (Dah and Frye).</p>

										<div class="title">
											<h3> CEO Compensation and Determinants </h3>
										</div>
										<p>CEO determinants are a combination of created variables and stock awards. We created an Ownership Ratio, Ownership Power, Year Served, and Prestige determinants. The Ownership Ratio is the CEO Stock Awards divided by BOD Stock Awards. This variables represent the equity power a CEO holds over a Board of Directors. If a CEO holds more equity than the board, then they hold more power over the company and have a greater influence on the board. We then created a determinant called Ownership Power. This is a binary categorical variable. This variable indicated whether the CEO Ownership Ratio was above the CEO Ownership Ratio median. We predict that CEO's with a higher ownership ratio will have more control over the firm and thus more influence on their pay. For Years Served, we took the difference between the year the CEO was on-boarded and the recorded year. CEO's that serve longer terms are more experienced and are more likley to receive higher pay. We based Prestige Power off of Years Served. Prestige power is a binary categorical variable that indicates whether time served is above the median. This implies a CEO can gain prestige power during their term (Bouteska and Mefteh-Wali)</p>

											<h3> Determinants of Firm Performance </h3>
										</div>
										<p>The review written by Sigo explores a wide variety of contributing factors to firm performance: profitability performance, growth performance, market value performance of the firm, customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, environmental audit performance, corporate governance performance and social performance. Although this may seem exhaustive, the paper did not actually test any of these variables as controls. For our analysis, we focused on the profitability performance, growth performance, and market value performance due to their availability in the compustate dataset. All of these determinants are later used to predict firm performance.</p>

											<h3> The Process</h3>
										</div>
										<p>Prior literature has individually examined the impact of Director compensation and CEO compensation on firm performance, but there are less studies that examine both variables together. Our research uses logistic regression to calculate an expected value for director and CEO compensation through their determinants while controlling for firm size and year. The expected value is then compared to the actual compensation to determine under or over compensation. These variables are used to create for different cases.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>CEOs and Directors are both overcompensated.</li>
											<li>CEOs and Directors are both undercompensated.</li>
											<li>CEO is overcompensated and Directors are undercompensated.</li>
											<li>CEO is undercompensated and Directors are overcompensated.</li>
										
										</ol>
										<p>These four cases are then correlated to firm performance after accounting for controls.</p>
										
										<hr />

											<h3> Method</h3>

										<div class="title">
											<h2> Regression Analysis for Director and CEO Compensation </h2>
										</div>

										<p>The regressions for director and CEO compensation were ran seperatley, but the overarching process is the same.</p>
										<p>Through our research, we learned that firms of different sizes have varrying payout structures to their executives and directors. We split the firms into 4 different size categories to allow for individual treatment during the regressions. Small firms were catagorized with a maximum market cap at $10 billion, followed by medium at $200 billion, large anything over $200 billion, and huge at ___.</p>
										<p>After splitting the firms in their respective bins, we ran a Ridge Regression on our determinates for compensation (Independent Variables) against director/CEO total compensation (Dependent variable).</p>
										<p>We used GridSearchCV to optimized each our models for the alpha and K value. After many iterations, the best_alpha function was used to pick the set of parameters that fit the data the best.</p>
										<code> add code for regression results</code>.
										<p>Despite optimizing, the model was unable to fit the firms in the "huge" bin within any degree of accuracy. This suggests that different determinates govern director compensation at giant firms. If we were to re-run the analysis, we would do more research to find different determinates. For the time being, we decided to omit the data because no meaningful predications could be made.</p>

											<h2> Regression Analysis for Director and CEO Compensation </h2>

										<p>Once we fit the models to the training data set, we used them to predict compensation for our holdout data. That provided us with a predicted compensation. We used this variable to create an overpayment variable.</p>
