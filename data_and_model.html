												<h2> Data</h2>
											</div>
											
										</header>
										<p>All of our data was extracted from WRDS. All data regarding director and CEO compensation and demographics came from Execucomp. Firm accounting variables and other firm specific information came from Compustat. All stock prices were pulled from CRSP.</p>
										<p>We cross referenced multiple studies to find determinants of CEO and director compensation as well as firm performance. Our sample size comprised of firms in the S&P500 from 2010 - 2019. We chose 2010-2019 to avoid the corporate scandals of the early 2000's and the impact of COVID on the market.</p>

											<h3> BOD Compensation and Determinants </h3>
										</div>
										<p>Director compensation was derived as their total compensation including cash, value of stock options and option awards, non-equity incentive plan compensation, change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings, and all other compensation.</p>
										<p>We used accounting based firm valuations and market performance as determinants for predicting Board of Directors compensation. The accounting variables are lagged one year, because we are assuming that pay is impacted by previous years performance. The accounting metrics of a firm are resilient to equity market changes. These metrics focus on internal firm performance, which will reduce the impact a strong market position will have on predicted compensation. A strong market artificially inflates firm values, even if the firm is not doing well internally. We included market performance determinants in our analysis because BOD packages usually contain some equity incentive (Dah and Frye).</p>

											<h3> CEO Compensation and Determinants </h3>
										</div>
										<p>CEO determinants are a combination of created variables and stock awards. We created an Ownership Ratio, Ownership Power, Year Served, and Prestige determinants. The Ownership Ratio is the CEO Stock Awards divided by BOD Stock Awards. This variables represent the equity power a CEO holds over a Board of Directors. If a CEO holds more equity than the board, then they hold more power over the company and have a greater influence on the board. We then created a determinant called Ownership Power. This is a binary categorical variable. This variable indicated whether the CEO Ownership Ratio was above the CEO Ownership Ratio median. We predict that CEO's with a higher ownership ratio will have more control over the firm and thus more influence on their pay. For Years Served, we took the difference between the year the CEO was on-boarded and the recorded year. CEO's that serve longer terms are more experienced and are more likley to receive higher pay. We based Prestige Power off of Years Served. Prestige power is a binary categorical variable that indicates whether time served is above the median. This implies a CEO can gain prestige power during their term (Bouteska and Mefteh-Wali)</p>

											<h3> Determinants of Firm Performance </h3>
										</div>
										<p>The review written by Sigo explores a wide variety of contributing factors to firm performance: profitability performance, growth performance, market value performance of the firm, customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, environmental audit performance, corporate governance performance and social performance. Although this may seem exhaustive, the paper did not actually test any of these variables as controls. For our analysis, we focused on the profitability performance, growth performance, and market value performance due to their availability in the compustate dataset. All of these determinants are later used to predict firm performance.</p>
