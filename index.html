										<h2>Effects of Ceo and Director Compensation on Firm Performance</h2>
										<p>Welcome to our Project!</p>

									<h2>Abstract:</h2>
									<p>This study examines the impact of CEO and Director compensation and firm performance. After conducting regression on a series of determinants to determine if CEOs and directors were overcompensated, four use cases were created with the following hypotheses:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Both CEOs and directors are overcompensated: Firm performance will suffer due to backscratching and underperforming executives.</li>
										
										<li>The CEO is overcompensated and directors are undercompensated: Firm performance will excel due to a more qualified CEO and strong controls over the board of directors.</li>
										<li>The CEO is undercompensated and directors are overcompensated: Firm performance will suffer because the directors are self serving and less motivated to replace the CEO in fear of loosing their compensation.</li>
										<li>Both CEOs and directors are undercompensated: Firm performance will excel because the firm has strong governance to prevent overcompensation.</li>
									</ol>
									<p>These hypotheses were correlated with a firm performance variable that was created through regression using a series of control determinants. The study found that large firms, overpayment is negatively correlated with firm performance; small firms, overpayment is positively correlated with firm performance, and the medium firms are right in the middle. There were several sources of error contributing to the many missing variables from the WRDS database for the S&P 500 and we had too few variables to conclude a concrete result. Further analysis should be conducted to explore more variables that are not a part of the WRDS dataset that we could have also used to have a deeper analysis.</p>
