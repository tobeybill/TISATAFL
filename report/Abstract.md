## Abstract:

This study examines the impact of CEO and Director compensation and firm performance (measured as Tobin's Q). After determining if CEOs and directors were overcompensated using regression on a series of determinants, four use cases were created with the following hypothesis'.

1.	CEOs and Directors are both overcompensated: Firm performance will suffer due to backscratching and underperforming executives.
2.	CEOs and Directors are both undercompensated: Firm performance will suffer due to underqualified executives.
3.	CEO is overcompensated and Directors are undercompensated: Firm performance will excel due to a more qualified CEO and strong controls over the board of directors.
4.	CEO is undercompensated and Directors are overcompensated: Firm performance will excel due to more qualified Directors and strong governing body's overseeing the CEO.

These four hypothesis were correlated with Tobin's Q and a series of control variables. The study found that ______________________________. There were several sources of error contributing to _____ and _______. Further analysis should be conducted to explore _______.
