## Abstract:

This study examines the impact of CEO and Director compensation and firm performance. After conducting regression on a series of determinants to determine if CEOs and directors were overcompensated, four use cases were created with the following hypotheses:
1. Both CEOs and directors are overcompensated: Firm performance will suffer due to backscratching and underperforming executives.
2. Both CEOs and directors are undercompensated: Firm performance will excel because the firm has strong governance to prevent overcompensation.
3. The CEO is overcompensated and directors are undercompensated: Firm performance will excel due to a more qualified CEO and strong controls over the board of directors.
4. The CEO is undercompensated and directors are overcompensated: Firm performance will suffer because the directors are self serving and less motivated to replace the CEO in fear of loosing their compensation.

These hypotheses were correlated with a firm performance variable that was created through regression using a series of control determinants. The study found that _____________. There were several sources of error contributing to _______ and _______. Further analysis should be conducted to explore _______.
