## Intro:

Executive compensation has ballooned over the past 40 years with an increase in pay of 1,167% relative to the growth of the S&P 500 at 741% (Bouteska & Mefteh-Wali). This discrepancy has raised many eyebrows in academia, the public, and media. If the growth of compensation of executives has outweighed the growth of the market, are the higher ups really performing better or have they colluded with their governing bodies (the board of directors) to pay to give themselves an outsized share of the profits? Furthermore, what impact does this have on firm performance?

A study written by Mustafa Dah and Melissa Frya developed a model to predict the expected compensation of directors and used that to study it's impacts on the firm. They found that directors were overcompensated more often than not, and that their average overcompensation exceeded the average undercompensation. Overcompensation leads to reduced CEO turnover sensitivity and a decrease in CEO pay-for performance sensitivity (Dah & Frya). This indicates that overpaid directors may be hesitant to remove CEO's in fears of the replacement decreasing their pay. Additionally, overpaid directors may be less likley to doc CEO pay for poor performance in case the CEO decided to retaliate and doc their pay as well. 

Another study touches on the determinants of CEO compensation through 2006-2016. The study found several categories of determinants that impacted compensation: accounting and performance, CEO power, and governance. CEO pay had a higher correlation on firm performance in more mature firms when compared to younger firms. High CEO power over the board led to an increase in compensation, while strong governance led to a decrease in compensation (Bouteska & Mefteh-Wali). 

A paper on the impact of CEO compensation and director compensation on firm performance found a strong positive correlation between CEO and director compensation. The paper also found a relationship between overcompensation and underperformance; concluding that overcompensation is due to poor governance and backscratching (Brick, Palmon, & Wald). The research heavily influence our own research and prompted us to further explore these relationships.
