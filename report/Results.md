# Results

After running the correlations between the overpayment variables and the firm performance score for each case, we found the following results.

## Correlation Tables

We found that there was very strong correlation between CEO overpayment and firm performance for small firms, and an equally as strong negative correlation for the larger firms. For those in the mid-size, there wasn't much change.

We found the opposite for directors, that there was very strong correlation between BOD overpayment and firm performance for large firms but a negative correlation for overpayment for the small ones.

Visually, it can be observed that there is a much larger scale for overcompensation on the part of the CEOs, wich an outlier being above 1600% of predicted pay. On the BOD side, a separate outlier sits at roughly 800% of predicted pay. Additionally, it appears that medium-sized firms are most responsible for CEO overpayment wheras smaller firms are more responsible for director overpayment. In both cases, firm performance for larger firms seems to be less volatile than that for the other two size categories.


## Case Analysis

Separating out our various firms in the above four cases, we found that large firms with an underpaid CEO and overpaid BOD perform the best and small firms with underpaid CEO and BOD perform the worst. It is also important to note that, for large firms, overpayment of the CEO results in poor performance while for the other two sizes it improves firm performance. For small firms especially, the overpayment of the CEO very heavily impacts the firm performance. 


## Conclusion

This supports our hypothesis
1. Both CEOs and directors are overcompensated: Firm performance will suffer in large firms due to backscratching and underperforming executives, but is improved for mid-size and small firms.
2. The CEO is overcompensated and directors are undercompensated: Firm performance will excel in mid-size and small firms due to a more qualified CEO and strong controls over the board of directors, but will be hurt in large firms.
3. The CEO is undercompensated and directors are overcompensated: Firm performance will suffer in small firms because the directors are self serving and less motivated to replace the CEO in fear of loosing their compensation.
4. Both CEOs and directors are undercompensated: Firm performance will excel in large and mid-size firms because the firm has strong governance to prevent overcompensation, but will suffer for the smaller size firms due to lack of adequate motivation.
