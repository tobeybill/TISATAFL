# Results

After running the correlations between the overpayment variables and the firm performance score for each case, we found the following results.

## Correlation Tables

We found that there was very strong correlation between CEO overpayment and firm performance for small firms, and an equally as strong negative correlation for the larger firms. For those in the mid-size, there wasn't much change.

We found the opposite for directors, that there was very strong correlation between BOD overpayment and firm performance for large firms but a negative correlation for overpayment for the small ones.

Visually, it can be observed that there is a much larger scale for overcompensation on the part of the CEOs, wich an outlier being above 1600% of predicted pay. On the BOD side, a separate outlier sits at roughly 800% of predicted pay. Additionally, it appears that medium-sized firms are most responsible for CEO overpayment wheras smaller firms are more responsible for director overpayment. In both cases, firm performance for larger firms seems to be less volatile than that for the other two size categories.


## Case Analysis




## probably another table or just written woods.

This ___ 's our hyothesis
1. Both CEOs and directors are overcompensated: Firm performance will suffer due to backscratching and underperforming executives.
2. Both CEOs and directors are undercompensated: Firm performance will excel because the firm has strong governance to prevent overcompensation.
3. The CEO is overcompensated and directors are undercompensated: Firm performance will excel due to a more qualified CEO and strong controls over the board of directors.
4. The CEO is undercompensated and directors are overcompensated: Firm performance will suffer because the directors are self serving and less motivated to replace the CEO in fear of loosing their compensation.
